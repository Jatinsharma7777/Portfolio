# Profile Image Setup

The profile image you provided needs to be manually placed at:
`c:\website\assets\images\profile.jpg`

Please save your black and white artistic profile photo to this location.

Alternatively, you can update the image path in `index.html` line 59:
```html
<img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-img">
```

Change it to point to wherever your profile image is located.
